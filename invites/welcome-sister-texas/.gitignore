# Specific to Vite/React if used within subfolders
# If you have specific build outputs for each invite,
# ensure those are also ignored within their respective invite folders' .gitignore.
# For example, if 'welcome-sister-texas' has its own 'dist' or 'build' folder,
# it should also have 'dist/' or 'build/' in its .gitignore.
