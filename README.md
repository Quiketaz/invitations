# Invitations Repository

This repository serves as a collection of digital invitations for various events. Each invitation is typically a standalone web project (HTML/CSS/JS or a React app) designed to be easily shareable via links.

## Structure

The repository is organized to keep different invitations separate and manageable:

invitations/
├── invites/
│   ├── welcome-sister-texas/       # Your current HTML invitation
│   │   └── ... (project files for this invite)
│   ├── another-event-invite/       # Future invitation projects go here
│   │   └── ...
