My Invitations Project
This repository holds the web-based invitations for various personal events.

Each event has its own dedicated folder.

How to View
The easiest way to see all available invitations is to open the main index file:

./index.html

This file acts as a central hub, linking to each individual event invitation.

Event Folders

/thanksgiving/ - Thanksgiving Potluck Dinner
/enrique-birthday/ - Enrique's Birthday Celebration
/welcome-sister-texas/ - Welcome Party for my Sister

To view a specific invite, you can navigate into its folder and open the index.html file located inside.
